# Task Tracker (CLI)

This is a command-line Task Tracker app I'm building in Python.

## What this project will do
- Add new tasks
- View tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Track status for each task (todo / in-progress / done)

## Why I'm building this
- I'm learning backend fundamentals like:
  - how to store data
  - how to read/update that data
  - how to design simple logic/flow
- I don't just want to copy code. I want to understand what the code is doing.

## Current status
- Local dev environment is set up on Windows 11
- Python file (`task_tracker.py`) runs from the terminal
- Git repo has been initialized (not yet pushed to GitHub)

## Next steps
- Commit this project with Git
- Push to GitHub so it's public
- Start building the actual task tracker features
