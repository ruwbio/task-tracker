# Task Tracker (CLI)

A command-line Task Tracker app written in Python.

You can:
- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- All tasks are persisted to disk in a JSON file so they don't disappear when you close the program

This project is part of my backend fundamentals practice. Iâ€™m building it from scratch instead of copying so I understand:
- how to structure code across files
- how to store and update state
- how to design a simple CLI API

## How to Run

First, open Command Prompt and go to the project folder:

```bash
cd C:\Users\gamin\Desktop\task-tracker
